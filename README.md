## Hi, I'm Roger Fan

I'm Roger Fan, Gunn HS '24. Slowly suffocating on the hedonic treadmill of Bio TRGs.
I know HTML/CSS/JS, NodeJS, Java, Python, and a little C++, but only use JS and Java. I use Github mainly to store code in case my computer suddenly decides to embrace the sweet release of death without my approval.

If you need anything, you probably know me and have means of contacting me.
