## "Knawledge"
*--Tai Lopez*

I'm Roger Fan. You probably don't know me. If you do know me, go away. If you don't, I will now proceed to consume your goldfish.

Now I will misuse the given template for my profile:

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** my computer. Yes it's a Mac, and from experience, I can tell you that Macs suck. I'm also working in Javascript, and if your main language is Python, we legally cannot be friends.

- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** that maybe procrastinating during the day and destroying my slep schedule probably isn't the best way to prepare for the school year.

- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** nothing. Because "that's social interaction and I don't support it." - Michael Reeves.

- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with** sorting out my life, which I think is impossible, but I'm wiling to try for the 7812th time.

- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** my existential crisis. Ever wanted to feel unmotivated for an extended period of time? Hit me up

- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** Pick your answer: 
1. Use your arms, jeez. I don't understand what you're trying to ask for.
2. Go train for another 1000 years
3. @realDonaldTrump on Twitter, where taxes, death, and Trump spreading misinformation are the 3 constants of life.
4. Go through the lengthy process of spamming merge requests until I notice, then reset all clocks within a 1 mile radius of you to 12:00 midnight at the noon of the 9th day of the 6th month, then recite the alphabet backwards while humming the tune to Rick Astley's hit single Never Gonna Give You Up while beating quintets over eighth notes, and I will be summoned immediately.
5. rogerjoeyfan@gmail.com i have a middle name and if you bring it up I will immediately be teleported outside your window and will use dark magic to send you into realm where up is down and down is up. If I don't immediately respond to your email or google hangouts invite it means I despise you specifically because of that one dumb thing you did when you were 5 but still cringe from 10 years later ok im done.

- ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** He him go call me anything honestly i don't get offended by these things

### Ok so User Info
Roger Fan
Student and Full-Time Procrastinator
rogerjoeyfan@gmail.com is my gmail, I literally have no social media except for Google Hangouts and maybe Discord because I have an irrational phobia of all things starting with "Insta-", "Twit-", "Face-", "Snap-", "Redd-", "Pinte-", "Sky-", "Zo-", "Schoolog-", and "Never Gonna Gi-".

Go check on your goldfish now goodbye
