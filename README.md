## "Knawledge"
*--Tai Lopez*

I'm Roger Fan. You probably don't know me. If you do know me, go away. If you don't, I will now proceed to consume your goldfish.

Now I will misuse the given template for my profile:

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** my computer. Yes it's a Mac, and from experience, I can tell you that Macs suck. I'm also working in Javascript, and if your main language is Python, we legally cannot be friends.

- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** that maybe procrastinating during the day and destroying my slep schedule probably isn't the best way to prepare for the school year.

- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on** nothing. Because "that's social interaction and I don't support it." - Michael Reeves.

- ðŸ¤” **Iâ€™m looking for help with** sorting out my life, which I think is impossible, but I'm wiling to try for the 7812th time.

- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** my existential crisis. Ever wanted to feel unmotivated for an extended period of time? Hit me up

- ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** Pick your answer: 
1. Use your arms, jeez. I don't understand what you're trying to ask for.
2. Go train for another 1000 years
3. @realDonaldTrump on Twitter, where taxes, death, and Trump spreading misinformation are the 3 constants of life.
4. rogerjoeyfan@gmail.com Yes I have a middle name if you bring it up ever I will personally feed you to the underrealm

- ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** He him go call me anything honestly i don't get offended by these things

### Ok so User Info
Roger Fan
Student and Full-Time Procrastinator
rogerjoeyfan@gmail.com is my gmail, I literally have no social media except for Google Hangouts and maybe Discord because I have an irrational phobia of all things starting with "Insta-", "Twit-", "Face-", "Snap-", "Redd-", "Pinte-", "Sky-", "Zo-", "Schoolog-", and "Never Gonna Gi-".

Go check on your goldfish now goodbye
